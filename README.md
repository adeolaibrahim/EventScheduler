# Event Scheduler (C++)

This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming in C++ with three classes:
- **Time**: Represents hours and minutes with validation.
- **Date**: Represents year, month, and day with validation.
- **Event**: Represents an event with title, date, start time, and end time.

## 🚀 Features
- Validate minutes (0–59) and adjust automatically.
- Validate year (1970–2050), month (1–12), and day (based on month).
- Print time in `HH:MM` format (e.g., `02:05`).
- Print date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `2025-01-02`).
- Print event details with title, date, start time, and end time.
